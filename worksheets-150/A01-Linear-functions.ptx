          Allometry is the study of the relative size of different parts of a body as a consequence of growth.
          An example of an allometric relation is the hypothesis that the weight of a fish is
        </p>

        <p>
          proportional to the cube of its length.
          Do the data in the table support this hypothesis,
          namely that (approximately) <m>y = kx^3</m>?
          If so, estimate the constant of
          proportionality, <m>k</m>.
